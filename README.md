## First what is bootloader ?
  - A bootloader is a small software program that resides on a microcontroller and is responsible for loading the main application code. It essentially acts as an intermediary between the microcontroller and the device used to program it.
     Here's a breakdown of why bootloaders are important:
    - Easier Programming:  Traditionally, programming a microcontroller required specialized hardware tools. A bootloader eliminates this need by allowing you to upload new code through a communication interface like USB, serial, or even wirelessly.
    - Firmware Updates: Bootloaders make firmware updates a breeze. You can develop and upload new versions of the main application code without needing physical access to the microcontroller itself.
    - Flexibility: Bootloaders provide flexibility during development. If there are bugs in the main program, you can easily upload a fix without going through the entire programming process again.
